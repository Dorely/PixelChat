# PixelChat - Agent Operating Guidelines

## Required Context

- At the start of every session, read `VISION.md`, `FILEMAP.md`, and
  `docs/architecture.md` completely before doing substantive work.
- Treat `VISION.md` as product direction, `docs/architecture.md` as the current
  technical and product-constraint reference, and `FILEMAP.md` as a navigation
  aid. None of them is proof that a feature is already implemented.
- Confirm current behavior in code before planning or changing it.
- Keep this file limited to durable agent behavior. Put product direction in
  `VISION.md` and technical decisions, boundaries, and changing implementation
  guidance in `docs/architecture.md`.

## Repository Readiness

- Before beginning new work, inspect the current branch, working tree, index,
  configured remotes, and upstream status.
- Start feature work only from a clean working tree whose index matches `HEAD`.
- If existing changes form coherent prior work, finish their verification and
  documentation, then commit them before beginning a new feature. Never mix
  unrelated unfinished work into a new change.
- Inspect every existing diff before committing it. If changes are unfamiliar,
  incomplete, unsafe to commit, or owned by another active effort, stop and ask
  for direction instead of discarding, hiding, or overwriting them.
- When an upstream exists, fetch its current state and ensure the working branch
  has no unintegrated upstream commits before starting. Fast-forward when safe;
  stop for direction if histories have diverged. Never rewrite published history
  without explicit instruction.
- When no remote or upstream exists, require a clean local `HEAD` and report that
  remote synchronization could not be checked.

## Research and Impact Analysis

- Research the codebase before implementation. Use `rg` or an equivalent fast
  search to find every use of the feature, concept, type, route, setting, and
  terminology being changed.
- Trace direct and indirect impact through domain models, EF persistence and
  migrations, repositories, services, providers, dependency registration,
  assistant tools and prompts, app-process runtimes, visible workspace state,
  Razor UI, JavaScript, serialization, configuration, media endpoints,
  documentation, and build tooling wherever applicable.
- Read callers and consumers, not only the file named in the request. Treat the
  requested location as a starting point rather than the full scope.
- Before replacing a concept, identify all old names, registrations, stored
  forms, and code paths that must disappear. Search for them again after
  implementation.
- For nontrivial work, form an impact plan before editing and keep it current as
  new dependencies are discovered.

## Implementation Standards

- Deliver the smallest coherent change that fully completes the requested
  behavior across every affected layer.
- Reuse or extend existing code, components, contracts, and patterns wherever
  possible. Search for an existing implementation before creating another one.
- Treat future maintainability as a first-class requirement. Prefer clear
  ownership, cohesive feature areas, explicit contracts, consistent naming, and
  straightforward control flow over locally convenient shortcuts.
- Add an abstraction only when it creates a clear boundary or removes meaningful
  duplication. Do not create parallel helpers or generic dumping grounds.
- Use dependency injection for services and repositories. Keep UI components
  focused on interaction state; put persistence, provider resolution, image
  workflow, sprite behavior, and chat behavior in their owning services.
- Keep provider-specific transport details behind provider-neutral contracts.
  Put configuration in `appsettings.json` and environment variables.
- Do not store new secrets directly on feature entities. Add them through
  `ISecretStore`, and never log credentials, OAuth codes, or tokens.
- **Hard rule: never leave the runtime in an obsolete state.** When a feature,
  concept, name, model, configuration, or code path becomes unused or is
  superseded, delete it completely in the same change.
- Do not retain dead branches, commented-out implementations, stale
  registrations, duplicate paths, compatibility shims, legacy aliases, or
  outdated documentation. If persisted data or an external boundary requires a
  transition, complete the migration and remove the old runtime path as part of
  the feature; otherwise stop and obtain an explicit migration plan.
- Preserve applied EF Core migrations as immutable schema history. Represent
  schema changes with forward migrations; historical migration files are not
  runtime compatibility paths and must not be deleted merely because their
  original model was later superseded.
- Preserve unrelated user changes. If they prevent a clean starting state, stop
  and resolve ownership before implementation. Never use a destructive reset or
  checkout to simplify the task.

## Code Style

- Follow `.editorconfig` as the code-style and naming authority.
- Use PascalCase for public members and `_camelCase` for private instance fields,
  consistent with the configured naming rules.
- Keep Electron-specific behavior in the desktop host path and provider-specific
  behavior in the owning adapter. Shared workbench behavior belongs behind the
  service contracts described in `docs/architecture.md`.

## Documentation Maintenance

- Update `FILEMAP.md` in the same change after adding, deleting, renaming, or
  materially repurposing a tracked source or project-support file.
- Keep each `FILEMAP.md` entry to one or two lines and never list generated build
  output.
- Update `docs/architecture.md` in the same change whenever work alters the
  technology stack, project boundaries, component responsibilities, data flow,
  persistence, provider behavior, platform support, security posture, or
  validation commands.
- Update `README.md` when user-facing capabilities, requirements, setup, run,
  packaging, or local-data behavior changes.
- Update `VISION.md` only when the product direction or scope has intentionally
  changed.
- Remove stale comments, examples, documentation, settings, and instructions as
  part of the feature that makes them obsolete.

## Verification

- Verify changes in proportion to their impact using the relevant builds,
  existing tests, static checks, and runtime checks documented in
  `docs/architecture.md`.
- Do not add test projects or automated tests unless the user explicitly
  requests them. Run and maintain relevant tests when they already exist.
- Verify normal source changes with `dotnet build PixelChat.sln`. After a
  successful build, run `dotnet run --project PixelChat`, confirm the local host
  starts without startup exceptions, and terminate it.
- Never start a host, Electron shell, browser automation, or sidecar without a
  plan to terminate it after validation.
- Do not run Playwright, screenshots, browser UI checks, Electron window checks,
  or manual UI validation unless the user explicitly requests them.
- When Electron startup itself must be smoke-checked, start
  `dotnet run --project PixelChat -- --electron`, confirm startup, and terminate
  the app. Never leave the app running.
- Do not claim OAuth, provider calls, image generation, local background removal,
  packaging, or platform-specific Electron behavior works unless the relevant
  integration and target platform have actually been exercised. Clearly report
  any validation that remains unperformed.
- Before completion, search for obsolete names and paths, inspect the complete
  diff, and confirm that documentation matches the resulting code.

## Completion and Commits

- A feature is complete only when its full impact area is implemented, obsolete
  runtime code is removed, documentation is current, and relevant verification
  succeeds.
- Once a feature is complete, inspect the final diff and status, stage only that
  feature's files, and create a focused commit with a descriptive message.
- Commit every completed feature before beginning another one. Do not combine
  unrelated work in a single commit.
- After committing, verify that the working tree is clean. Do not amend, squash,
  force-push, or otherwise rewrite history unless explicitly requested.
- If a required commit cannot be created, report the blocker and do not describe
  the feature as completed.
